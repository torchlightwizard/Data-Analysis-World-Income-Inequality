# Problem
1. How should we analyze data. That shows a lot of categories. And alot of them do not have enough data to formulate good trends or analytics.

2. Each of the Economic/Population scales of measurement is a separate metric, therefore cannot be combined. There are 27 of them.

3. Should World Bank's "incomegroup" be treated as unique too like the Economic/Population scales or can they be combined?



# Possible Solutions
1. Maybe some categories can be ignored in favour of other categories. E.g rural vs urban for all countries, where specific country is ignored.
E.g Specific country combined, disregarding if its mostly a rural country or not.

We can choose a specific metric, E.g median currency, and group them by categories of choice e.g population, region, reference period etc.

3. Maybe we dont require to group data based on "incomegroup" because it is a label and not a scale of measurement.
